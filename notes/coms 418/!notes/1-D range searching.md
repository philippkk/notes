- [[1-D range searching]]
		- a set of points on the x-axis 
			- $P = \{p_1,p_2,...,p_n\}$
			- Query range $[x,x']$ : find all points inside 
			- solution 1: array + sorting + binary search in optimal
				- $O(\log n + k)$ run time
		- Does not generalize to higher dimensions
		- 		- Solution 2: balanced binary search tree T
			- Leaves: $p_1,p_2,...p_n$
			- internal nodes: splitting values
			- at node v: splitting value $x_1$
			- ![[binary tree.heic]]
			- Query range $[x,x']$
				- Search with $x$ and $x'$ in $T$
					- end at two leaves $\mu$ and $\mu'$
					- report points stored between $\mu$ and $\mu'$ 
					- possibly also points stored at $\mu$ and $\mu'$
