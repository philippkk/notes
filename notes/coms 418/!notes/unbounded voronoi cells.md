- ##### [[unbounded voronoi cells]]
		- $V(p_i)$ is unbounded if $p_i$ lies on the boundary of the convex hull of $P$
		- only case of disconnected VD
			- all sites are collinear
		- only $n-1$ sites collinear
		- only one vertex 
			- all sites are on the same circle
		- not all sites are collinear 
			- $V(p_i)$ connected with two types of edges
				- line segments
				- half-lines
