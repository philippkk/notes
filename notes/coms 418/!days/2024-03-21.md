### Point set triangulation
- #### Terrain
	- 2-d surface in 3D space such that every vertical line intersects in $\leq 1$ point
	- $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$
- #### Height interpolation
	- sample the value of $h$ at a finite set
		- $P=\{p_1,\dots,p_n\} \subseteq A$
	- approximate h(q) for every $q \in A/P$
	- *naive approach*
		- $h(q) = h(p_i)$
		- where $|q-p_i|\leq|q-p_j|$
	- *better interpolation*
		- Determine a triangulation of $P$
		- lift every sample point to its height
	- *barycentric interpolation*
		- $A = A_1 + A_2 + A_3:$ area of $\Delta\ p_1\ p_2\ p_3$
		- $q=\frac{A_1}{A}p_1+\frac{A_2}{A}p_2+\frac{A_3}{A}p_3 \rightarrow$
			- $h(q)=\frac{A_1}{A}h(p_1)+\frac{A_2}{A}h(p_2)+\frac{A_3}{A}h(p_3)$
		- barycentric coordinates of $q: (\frac{A_1}{A}.\frac{A_2}{A},\frac{A_3}{A})$
- #### Triangulation of a planar point set
	- a planar subdivision $S$ is maximal if no *straight* edge connecting two vertices can be added without destroying its planarity
		- a triangulation of a pint set $P=\{p_1,\dots,p_n\}$ is the maximal planar subdivision whose vertex set is $P$
	- *existence of a triangulation*
		- every bounded face of such a planar subdivision with vertex set $P$ is a polygon
		- union of bounded faces is the convex hull of $P$
		- unbounded face is the complement of the convex hull (the remaining region in the plane)
	- *complexity of triangulation*
		- assume the n points in $P$ are not all collinear 
		- *Theorem* Any triangulation of $P$ has $2n-2$ triangles and $3n-3-k$ edges
			- *proof* $T$ is a triangulation with $m$ triangles
				- $n_e = edges$
				- $n_f = faces = m + 1$
				- count edges in two different ways:
					1. every triangle has three edges the unbounded face has $k$ edges
					2. every edge is incident to two faces
					- $3m+k=2n_e$
				- $m = 2n - 2 -k$
				- $n_e = 3n - 3 -k$
- ### Angle Vector
	- $T:$ triangulation with $m$ triangles which have $3m$ angles
		- order these angles into an *angle vector*
			- $A(T) = \langle \alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_{3m}\rangle$ 
		- $T'$ is another triangulation with a angle vector
			- $A(T') = \langle \alpha'_1,\dots,\alpha'_{3m}\rangle$ 
		- $A(T) > A(T')$ if there exists $i$ with $1\leq i \leq 3m$ such that $\alpha_j = \alpha'_j$ for all $j < i$ and $\alpha_i > \alpha'_i$
		- $T$ is angle optimal if $A(T) \geq A(T')$ for all triangulations $T'$
	- *Thales theorem*
		- four angles subtended by the arc $\widehat{ab}:$
		- $\angle arb > \angle apb = \angle aqb > \angle asb$
	- *Illegal Edge*
		- an edge $e = \overline{p_ip_j}$ is incident to two triangles
		- $e$ is an illegal edge if $min_{1\leq i\leq 6} \alpha_i < min_{1\leq i \leq 6} \alpha'_i$
	- *edge flip*
		- can be shown $A(T') > A(T)$
	- *determining an illegal edge*
		- *theorem* Edge $\overline{p_ip_j}$ is illegal if $p_i$ lies in the interior of circle $C$ determined by $p_i,p_j,p_k$
		- *proof* let $T$ and $T'$ be the triangulations of the 4 points,$p_i,p_j,p_k,p_l$ before and after the flip
	- *special case and legal triangulation*
		- $p_i,p_j,p_k,p_l$ are cocircular
		- both $\overline{p_ip_j}$ and $\overline{p_kp_l}$ are legal
		- a *legal triangulation* has no illegal edge
		- *generating a legal triangulation*
			- brute force code in notes
- ### Delaunay Triangulation
	- *Planarity*
		- *theorem* $DG(P)$ (Delaunay graph)is a planar graph
		- *proof* use a property of Vor(P): edge$\overline{p_ip_j} \in DG(P)$ if there is a closed disk $C_{ij}$
			- centered at point $o_{ij}$ on the bisector 
			- with $p_i,p_k$ on boundary
			- with no other site in its interior
