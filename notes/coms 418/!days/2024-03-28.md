### Discrepancy computation
- *rendering*
	- determine 
		- for every pixel on the screen which object is visible 
		- at that pixel the *intensity of light* emitted by the object in the direction of the viewpoint
	- ray tracing: shoot a ray through each pixel, first hit object is visible.
	- *how to determine light intensity?*
		- shoot multiple rays per pixel
		- sample points within a pixel are chosen randomly
		- $m$ out of $n$ rays hit the object
			- *intensity* = $\frac{m}{n}$
		- *discrepancy* of the sample set:
			- $\%$ of hits on an object - $\%$ of visible pixel area for it
	- *half plane discrepancy*
		- the maximum discrepancy of any closed half plane
			- $\Delta(S) = sup_h\Delta _s(h)$
		- how to compute?
			- check every half plane that has local maximum discrepancy
				- slight rotation or translation of the half plane will decrease the discrepancy 
			- pick one of them that has the largest value of these local maxima
		- *half plane achieving local maximum*
			- suppose $h$ does not contain a point on its boundary
				- translate $h$ downward before hitting a point
				- $\mu _s(h)$ does not change
				- $\mu(h)$ decreases
			- $\Delta _s(h) = \mu(h) - \mu_s(h)|$ decreases or increases 
			- *claim* a half plane of local maximum must have a point on its boundary
		- *half plane rotation*

- ### Duality
	- *point line duality*
		- Point $p = (p_x,p_y)$
		- line $p*: y = p_xx-p_y$
			- primal plane - the point
			- dual plane - the line
		- Line $l: y = mx + b$
		- point $l* = (m -b)$
			- primal plane - the line
			- dual plane - the point
	- *dual of the dual and incidence*
		- $(p*)* = p)$
		- $p \in l \leftrightarrow l* \in p*$
	- *points on a vertical line*
		- no dual defined for a vertical line (x = a)
	- *relative point line position*
		- $p$ lies above $l$ if and only if $l*$ likes above $p*$
	- *duals of points on a line segment*
