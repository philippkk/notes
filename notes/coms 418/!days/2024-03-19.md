## Farthest point voronoi diagrams
- $P = \{p_1,\dots,p_2\}$ = sites
- given a point $q,p_i \in P$ is its father point if for all $1 \leq j leq ?$
- ### not every site can be the farthest 
	- Claim- a point $p_i \in P$ is the farthest site of some point $q$ in the plane if and only if $p_i$ is a vertex of the convex hull CH(P) of $P$
		- #### proof of necessity
			- suppose there exists some $q$ such that. $p_i$ is its farthest site
			- assume that $p_i is not a vertex of CH(P)
				- Then $p_i$ is either in the interior CH(P) or on one of its edfe
				- Consider the line $l$ through $p_i$ and $q$ (clearly $p_i \not = q$)
				- $l$ intersects CH(P) with two of its edge $e_1$ and $e_2$
				- one of the four endpoints of $e_1$ and $e_2$ must be farther from $q$ than $p_i$
		- #### proof of sufficiency
			- suppose $p_i$ is a vertex of CH(P)
			- $p_i$ must be extreme is some direction $\overrightarrow{d}$
			- let $l$ be the line through $p_i$ in $\overrightarrow{d}$
				- start at $p_i$
				- move on $l$ in direction -$\overrightarrow{d}$
- ### Two sites
	- #### Voronoi Cell
		- $V'(p_i) = \bigcap_{1\leq j \leq n, j \not = i}h(p_j,p_i)$ 
		- open convex region
		- $\leq n -1$ vertices and edges 
	- #### unboundedness 
		- the cell contains a ray $r$ collinear with $p_i$
- ### Farthest point voronoi diagram
	- Tree like structure 
	- edges include segments and half infinite lines
	- no cycles
		- a cycle would imply a bounded cell
	- a vertex has $\geq$ 3 farthest sites
	- any site that is not a vertex of the convex hull have no voronoi cell
		- it contributes no voronoi edge
		- every voronoi edge is part of a bisector of two convex hull vertices 
		- $O(n)$ vertices, edge, and cells
- ### center of smallest enclosing disk
	- Two possibilities:
		- Vertex $\rightarrow\ \geq 3$ equidistant farthest sites
		- midpoint of two sites defining and edge $\rightarrow$ two equidistant farthest sites
	- Storage
		- DCEL with midifications
			- half infinite edge
				- if no origin, stores the direction $(\overrightarrow{d})$ of the edge instead of coordinates
				- either next(e) or prev(e) is undefined 
- ### preprocessing for construction
	1. compute the convex hull CH(P) with $h$ vertices
		- Grahm scan ü§ó 
	2. order vertices of hull randomly
		- $p_1,\dots,p_h$ (new indices)
	3. remove $p_1,\dots,p_h$ one by one in the order
		- for each $p_i$ store its clockwise neighbor $cw(p_i)$ and its counterclockwise neighbor $ccw(p_i)$ at the time of removal
		- $p_i$ cannot be a neighbor of any point removed later
- ### construction
	1. initialize with the FPVD of $p_1,p_2,p_3$
	2. insert $p_4,p_5,\dots,p_h$ one by one in order
		- $FPVD_{i-1}$ for $\{p_1,\dots,p_{i=1}\}$
			- most counterclockwise half edge in a traversal of the boundary of $V'(p_j)$
		- How to add $p_i$
			- the cell $V'(p_i)$ of $p_i$ will come in between the adjacent cells $V'(cw(p_i))$ and $V'(ccw(p_I))$
			- $ccw(p_i)$ has a pointer to bisector $b$ (most counterclockwise edge in its cell)
			- bisector of $ccw(p_i)$ and $p_i$ will contribute a half edge to $V'(p_i)$
			- traverse the boundary of $V'(ccw(p_i))$ starting at $b$ in a clockwise way to find the intersection $q$ of $d$ with a boundary edge $b'$ between $V'(ccw(p_i))$ and, say $V'(p_j)$ of another site 
	- FPVD can be constructed in $O(nlogn)$ expected time using $O(n)$ storage
- ### roundness of a point set
	- The roundness of a set of points is measured by the minimum width of any annulus that contains the points
		- observation there must be one point each of $C_{outer}$ and $C_{inner}$
	- #### only three different cases
		- (a) $\geq 3$ points on $C_{outer}$
			- $\geq 1$ points on $C_{innner}$
		- (b) 1 3  
		- (c) 2 2
	- case a
		- the problem is equivalent to finding the center point $q$ of the annulus
		- $q$ must be a vertex of the farthest-point voronoi diagram
	- case b
		- $q$ must be a vertex of the nearest-point voronoi diagram
	- case c
		- $C_{outter}$ $q$ must be on an edge of the FPVD
		- $C_{inner}$ $q$ must be on an edge of the VD
	- #### overlay of VD and FPVD
		- picture üêÆüç∫
	- #### smallest width annulus algorithm
		1. construct the voronoi diagram and farthest point voronoi
		2. for every vertex $v$ of the FPVD (O(n) vertices)
			- its farthest sites $p_i,p_j,p_k$ are known ($C_{outter}$)
			- determine its close site $p_l$ using VD O(nlogn)
			- this yields a candidate annulus
		3. for every vertex $v$ of the VD
			- its closest sites are known ($C_{inner}$)
			- determine its farthest site $p_l$ using FPVD O(nlogn)
			- this yields a candidate annulus 
		4. for every pair of edges, one from VD and the other from FPVD $O(n^2)$ pairs
			- test if they intersect
			- if so, the two closest sites $p_i,p_j$ and two farthest sites $p_k,p_l$ are known. construct the annulus in O(1) time
		5. choose the smallest width annulus of all constructed annuli
		- Theorem, given a set of $n$ points in the plane, the smallest width annulus can be determined in $O(n^2)$ time using $O(n)$ storage
