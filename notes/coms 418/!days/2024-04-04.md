### convex hull in 3d
- *convex set*
	- a set $S \subseteq R^n$ is convex if the line segment $\overline{pq} \subset S$ for any pair of points $p,q\in S$
- *concave*
	- if the set odes not contain all the line segments
- *convex hull*
	- set of points $S \subseteq R^n$ is the intersection of all convex sets containing $S$.
- *non coplanar points in 3d*
	- tetrahedron (4 points)
		- $p=\lambda_1p_1+\lambda_2p_2+\lambda_3p_3+\lambda_4p_4$
			- where lambda $\geq$ 0 and sum up to 1
- *faces vs facets*
	- faces are features of all dimensions on a polyhedron
		- 0-faces = vertices
		- 1-faces = edges
		- 2-faces = facets = polygonal faces
	- the generalization of a polyhedron is the d-dimensional space is called a polytope
- *platonic solids*
	- convex polyhedra with equivalent faces composed of congruent convex regular polygons
	- also called the regular solids or regular polyhedra
	- only five types
- *complexity of a convex hull in 3d*
	- $S:$ a set of $n$ points $P:$ convex hull of $S$
	- *theorem* edges $\leq 3n-6$ and facets $\leq 2n-4$
	- *proof* the surface of a convex polyhedron can be seen as a planar graph
		- euler's now 
		- facet -> face
		- top facet -> unbounded face
			- every facet of the polyhedron has $\geq 3$ edges
			- every face of the planar graph has $\geq 3$ edges
			- every edge is adjacent to two faces
- *computing a convex hull*
	- randomized incremental construction
		- choose four points in S that are not co-planar
			- their convex hull is a tetrahedron
		- compute a random permutation
			- $P_r = \{p_1,\dots,p_r\} r\geq 1$
		- for $r \geq 5$ add $p_r$ to the convex hull $CH(P_{r-1})$
	- *visible facets*
		- $p_r$ outside $CH(P_{r-1})$
		- visible facets forma connected region on the surface of CH
		- boundary of this visible region is called the horizon of CH
		- *observation*
			- a facet $f$ is visible from $p_r$ if $p_r$ and CH lie on opposite sides of the plane containing $f$
	- *hull update*
		- strat
			- keep all invisible facets
			- replace all facets with facets connecting $p_r$ to its horizon
	- *degen handling*
		- check if $p_r$ lies in the plane of a facet of CH
	- *data structure*
