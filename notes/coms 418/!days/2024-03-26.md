### computing the delaunay triangulation
- legal triangulation = delaunay 🐮🍺
- #### the construction problem
	- input: a set $P$ of $n$ points
	- algo 1:
		- compute voronoi diagram Vor(P)
		- obtain DG(P)
		- triangulate faces with $> 3$ vertices 
	- algo 2:
		- introduce a set $\Omega = \{p_0,p_{-1},p_{-2}\}$ of three aux points such that $\Delta$ contains all points from $P$ in the interior
		- add points in random order, maintaining a Delaunay triangulation of the current set
			- in step $r$ find the triangle $\Delta p_ip_jp_k$ that contains the newly added $p_r$
				- case 1: $p_r$ in the interior 
				- case 2: $p_r$ on an edge
			- add edges from $p_r$ to the vertices of the containing triangle(s)
				- the new edges incident of $p_r$ are legal
			- replace illegal edges by legal edges through edge flips
		- edge legalization algo in slides
	- ##### correctness
		- need to prove that no illegal edges remain after all calls to legalize edge.
			- every new edge due to insertion of a point $p_r$ is incident to $p_r$
				- ensured by recursive calls
			- every new edge is legal
			- any edge that may become illegal is tested
