- #### Voronoi diagrams
	- ##### [[Vor(P) subdivision]]
		- $n$ cells ($1\leq i \leq n$)
		- $V(p_i)$ $\leftarrow$ voronoi cell
		- $V(p_i) = \{q | q \text{ closer to }p_j \text{ than to }p_i\}$
	- ##### [[Voronoi cells]]
		- $v(p_i) = \bigcap_{1\leq j\leq n ,\ j \not = i} h(p_i,p_j)$
		- open convex region (open set not necessarily unbounded)
		- possibly unbounded
		- $\leq n - 1$ vertices
		- $\leq n - 1$ edges 
	- ##### [[unbounded voronoi cells]]
		- $V(p_i)$ is unbounded if $p_i$ lies on the boundary of the convex hull of $P$
		- only case of disconnected VD
			- all sites are collinear
		- only $n-1$ sites collinear
		- only one vertex 
			- all sites are on the same circle
		- not all sites are collinear 
			- $V(p_i)$ connected with two types of edges
				- line segments
				- half-lines
	- #### Delaunay triangulation
		- Dual graph obtained by adding a line segment between every two sites sharing a voronoi edge
			- and edge and its dual may not even intersect
		- the dual graph is a triangulation of $P$
	- #### Complexity of Vor(P)
		- $\leq 2n -5$ vertices
		- $\leq 3n - 6$ edges
		- proof- let $n_v$ = num of vertices and $n_e$ = num of edges
			- add vertex $v_{\infty}$ far enough
			- extend all half line in Vor(P) to reach $v_{\infty}$
			- a planar graph
			- $(n_v +1)- n_e + n = 2$ (euler's formula)
				- every vertex has degree $\geq 3$
				- total degree $2n_e = \sum deg(v)\geq 3(n_v +1)$
					- $n_v \leq 2n-5$
					- $n_e \leq 3n-6$
	- #### Vertex
		- $C_p(q):$ largest circle centered at $q$ and not containing any site from $P$ in its interior
		- Theorem
			- $q$ is a vertex of Vor(P) if $c_p(q)$ passes through $\geq 3$ sites
				- proof- supposed q exists such that $C_p(q)$ passes through $\geq 3$ sites
				- $C_p(q)$ has no site in its interior
				- $q$ must be on the boundary of $V(p_i), V(p_j), V(p_k)$
				- $q$ is a vertex of Vor(P)
				- Vertex $q$ is adjacent to 4 edge
				- it is adjacent to three cells $V(p_i), V(p_j), V(p_k)$
				- $q$ is equidistant to $p_i,p_j,p_k$ 
				- missed the last part
			- bisector $b$ of $p_i$ ad $p_j$ is an edge of Vor(P) if for some point $r$ on $b, C_p(r)$ passes through $p_i$ and $p_j$ but no other sites
	- #### computing VD
		- naive algo
			- compute every voronoi cell $V(p_i)$
				- half plane intersection
					- $O(nlogn)$
				- $n$ cells
					- $O(n^2logn)$
		- line sweep algo
			- complications
				- $l$ may encounter the top vertex $v$ of the cel $V(p_i)$ before the site $p_i$
				- part of $Vot(P)$ above $l$ also depends on sites below $l$ 
		- point line bisector
			- locus of points equidistant to $p_i = (a_i,b_i)$ and $l:y = l_y$
				- $(x-a_i)^2+(y-b_i)^2=(y-l_u)^2$
				- $x^2 - 2a_ix+a_i^2 + b_i^2 - l_y^2 = 2(b_i - l_y)y$
					- parabola
				- all the points above the parabola are closer to $p_i$ than to $l$
		- beach line
			- parabolic arcs bounding the locus of points closer to some site above $l$ than to $l$
			- lower envelope of all the parabolas due to the sites above $l$
			- x-monotone
			- one parabola can contribute more than once
			- breakpoints lie on the edge of $Vor(P)$
			- they will trace out exactly $Vor(P)$ as $l$ moves from top to bottom
	- #### Two types of events
		- as the sweep line moves downward the beach lines topological structure changes when
			- a new parabolic arc appears
				- site event
					- the sweep line $l$ reaches a new site
					- see slides
			- a parabolic arc shrinks to a point and then vanishes
				- circle event
	- #### Tracing out voronoi edges
		- two new break points emerge right after a site event
		- they trace out the same edge in opposite directions
		- the edge $r_1r_2# is not connected to the rest of the (constructed) voronoi diagram
			- it will grow, missed it
	- #### site event summary
		- at a site event
			- a new arc appears on the beach line
			- a new voronoi edge starts to be traced out
		- Lemma, a new arc can only appear on the beach line via a site event
		- corollary, the beach line consists of. $\leq 2n -1$ parabolic arcs
			- proof - look on slides
