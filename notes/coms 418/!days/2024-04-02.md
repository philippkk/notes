### Line arrangements
- *arrangement of lines*
	- $L:$ a set of $n$ lines 
	- $A(L):$ planar subdivision induced by $L$
		- with unbounded edges and faces
	- *simple arrangement* if
		- no three lines are concurrent
		- no two lines are parallel
	- *reduction to line arrangement*
		- problem on points $\rightarrow$ problem on an arrangement of dual lines
	- *combinatorial complexity*
		- vertices + edges + faces
		- *theorem* vertices $\leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$
			- edges $\leq n^2$
			- face $\leq \frac{n^2}{2}+\frac{n}{2}+1$
			- equality holds if and only if simple
		- *proof*
			- first show that vertices, edges, faces are maximal when $A(L)$ is simple and not otherwise
				-  let $l \in L$ be parallel to one or more lines
					- small rotation to yield one change in $A(L)$
					- complexity then increases in this case
				- suppose $l$ passes through a vertex
					- translate $l$ slightly to create triangle
					- 2 vertices, 1 face, 3 edges
					- since complexity increases, such configuration cannot be maximal either
				- the maximal config must be simple
	- *exact size of a simple arrangement*
		- $n_v$ = vertices
		- $n_e$ = edges
		- $n_f$ = faces
		- any pair of lies intersect $n_v =$ $n \choose{2}$
		- Number of faces
			- add vertex $v_{\infty}$ at infinity 
			- extend every half infinite edge to $v_{\infty}$
				- no edge crossing
				- planar graph
			- euler's = $(n_v+1)+n_f-n_e = 2$ = $\frac{n^2}{2}+\frac{n}{2}+1$
	- *storage of line arrangement*
		- DCEL!
		- add bounding box to contain all vertices in interior
		- *construction*
			- plane sweep = $O(nlogn+l\ logn)$ = $O(n^2logn)$
				- pairwise intersection $l = n(n-1)/2$
				- bad
			- incremental algorithm
				- preprocessing
					- bounding box $B(L)$
