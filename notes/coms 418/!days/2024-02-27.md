# Construction of a trapezoidal map
- #### randomized incremental construction of D
	- Randomly order segments: $s_1,\dots,s_n$
	- add one segment at a time: $S_i = \{s_1,\dots,s_n\}$
	- after each addition update the search structure and trapezoidal map
		- algo in slides
```	c
for i = 1 to n
	do find trapezoids, d_o,d_k properly intersected by s_i
	replace with new trapezoids due to intersection by s_i
	remove leaves for d_o,d_k from D
	create the leaves for the trapezoids
```
- #### trapezoidal map modification
	- ##### how to add $s_i$
		- for every trapezoid $\Delta \in T(S_{i-1})$
			- $\Delta \not \in T(S_i)$
	- ##### intersected trapezoids
		- find trapezoids $\Delta_0,\dots,\Delta_k$ intersection by $s_i$
			- locate $\Delta_0$
				- point location problem with left endpoint $p_i$ of $s_i$ in $T(S_{i-1})$
				- use the current search structure $D(S_{i-1})$, missed last part
			- $\Delta_0 \rightarrow$ locate $\Delta_1 \rightarrow \dots$ locate $\Delta_k$
				- $\Delta_{j+1}$ is right neighbor of $\Delta_j$
				- in case that there are two right neighbors:
					- $s_i$ below rightp($\Delta_j$)
						- $\rightarrow \Delta_{j+1}$ is lower right neighbor
					- $s_i$ above rightp($\Delta_j$)
						- $\rightarrow \Delta_{j+1}$ is bottom right neighbor
			- Two degeneracies
				- $p_i$ lies on vertical line of an x-node in $T(S_{i-1})$
					- treat it as lying to the right of the x-node
				- $p_i$ is the left endpoint of a segment $s$ of a y-node
					- compare the slopes of $s$ and $s_i$ to determine above and below
		- ###### updating T and D
			- $s_i$ contained in $\Delta_0$
				- non-degenerate situation: 4 new trapezoids
			- degenerate situations
				- pics on slides
			- $s_i$ intersects $\geq 2$ trapezoids $\Delta_0,\dots,\Delta_k$
				- pic on slides
	- ##### Expected query time
		- let $q$ be a query point (fixed)
			- query time ~ length of path $\gamma$ traversed in $D$
			- bound the length of $\gamma$
			- every node on $\gamma$ was created in some iteration during construction
			- $X_i,1 \leq i \leq n$: num of nodes on $P$ created in iteration $i$
		- ###### Expected path length:
			- $E(\sum^n_{i=1}X_i) = \sum^n_{i=1}E(X_i)$
		- ###### Nodes added in one iteration
			- ==Fact==: any iteration adds $\leq$ 3 nodes to the search path $\gamma$
				- $X_i \leq 3$
		- ###### probability of node creation
			- $P_i$: probability that there is a node of the search path $\gamma$ of the query point $q$ which is created in iteration $i$
			- $E(X_i) \leq 3P_i$
			- iteration $i$ contributes at least one node to $\gamma$ if
				- $\Delta_q(S_i) \not = \Delta_q(S_{i-1})$ where $S_i = \{s_1,\dots,s_i\}$
			- $P_i = Pr(\Delta_q(S_i) \not = \Delta_q(S_{i-1}))$
			- $\Delta_q(S_i) \not = \Delta_q(S_{i-1}) \rightarrow \Delta_q(S_i)$ is created in iteration $i$
			- $\Delta_q(S_i)$ as trapezoid in $T(S_i)$ does not depend on the order of segments in $S_i$
		- ###### backward analysis
			- idea: look at the probability that $\Delta = \Delta_q(S_i)$ disappears when the segment $s_i$ is removed
				- if one of top, bottom ,leftp and righto disappears when $s_i$ is removed
			- disappearance of top($\Delta$)
				- every segment in $S_i$ is equally likely to be $s_i$
					-   $Pr(s_i=\text{top}(\Delta))=\frac{1}{i}$
			- disappearance of leftp or leftp
				- $s_i$ is only segment in $S_i$ with leftp as the end point
					- prob = $\leq \frac{1}{i}$
			- $P_i = Pr(\Delta_q(S_i) \not = \Delta_q(S_{i-1})) =$
				- $P_i = Pr(\Delta_q(S_i) \not \in T(S_{i-1}))\leq \frac{4}{i}$
			- $E(\sum^n_{i=1}X_i) \leq \sum^n_{i=1}3P_i \leq 12\sum^n_{i=1}\frac{1}{i} = 12H_n = \Theta(log n)$
				- $H_n$ = harmonic number
				- $ln(n) \leq H_n \leq 1+ln(n)$
