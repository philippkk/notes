### [[Planar Subdivision]]
- Made up of,
	- [[Vertex]]
	- [[edges]]
	- [[faces]]
	- [[holes]]
- [[Complexity]] = # vertices + # edges + # faces
### [[Doubly-Connected Edge List]]
- Stores geometric and topological info
	- To walk around face counterclockwise, set up
		- pointer to next edge
		- pointer to previous edge
	- Every edge has two distinct half-edges
		- one goes one way one goes the other, like a directed graph.
		- Edge $e$ has origin $v$ and destination $w$
			- twin has origin $w$ and destination $v$
	- For each face $f$ store one pointer to an arbitrary half-edge bounding the face.
	- Holes are traversed in clockwise order so the face still lies to the left.
- Summary of DCE
	- [[Vertex]] $v$ // O(1) info
		- Coordinates($v$)
		- IncidentEdge($v$) - pointer to an arbitrary half-edge originated from $v$
	- [[faces]] $f$ //Depends on num of inner components, and any edge is pointed to at most once from the list
		- OutComponent($f$) - pointer t some half-edge on the outer boundary.
		- InnerComponents($f$) - a list of pointers, each to some half-edge on the boundary of a different hole in the face.
	- [[edges]] $e$ O(1) info
		- Origin($e$)
		- Twin($e$)
		- Next($e$)
		- Prev($e$)
		- IncidentFace($e$) - face lying to the left of the half edge
	- total storage: O(num of all all three)
		- i.e. linear subdivision complexity
- How to find all edges of vertex
	- Start on half edge $e_0$ that has origin $v$
		- find twin of $e_0$, $e_1$
		- go to next outgoing half edge on $v$, counterclockwise.
		- repeat until back to $e_0$
