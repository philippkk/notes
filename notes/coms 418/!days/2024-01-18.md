### [[Graham Scan]] (pics inside)
- Steps:
	-  1. select node with smallest y coordinate
		- Tie breaker: select leftmost or rightmost point
	- 2. sort by polar angle with respect to $p_0$ 
		- $p_0$ is the lowest (and leftmost) meaning all polar angles $\in [0,\pi)$ 
		- **use cross product**. $p_i < p_j$ if $\overrightarrow{p_0p_i} \times \overrightarrow{p_0p_j} > 0$
			- If two points on same line, order by distance from $p_0$
				- to check if $p_i < p_j$ do, $\overrightarrow{p_0p_i} \cdot \overrightarrow{p_0p_i} <\overrightarrow{p_0p_j} \cdot \overrightarrow{p_0p_j}$
				- keep furthest point from $p_0$, others have no chance of being hull vertex
	- 3. Scan points in the increasing order of polar angle, maintaining a stack.
		- left turn = push
		- right turn = pop
			- determine if last was right turn using cross product and pop 
			- finally push
	- RUNTIME: $O(nlogn)$
### [[V. Jarvis March]]
- basically just the outside most points
- Start at lowest point
	- sort all points by polar angle
	- pick point with smallest angle relative to starting point
	- resort from new point and repeat
- RUNTIME: $O(nh)$

**MARCH IS ONLY BETTER ON PROBLEMS WITH A KNOWN CONSTANT NUMBER OF EDGE VERTEX**

# Segment Intersection

### Straightforward approach:
- 1. Construct the lines $l_1$ and $l_2$ containing the two segments.
	- $l_1: (a_1,b_1,c_1) = (x_1,y_1,1)\times (x_2,y_2,1) //a_1x+b_1y+c_1=0$
	 - $l_2: (a_2,b_2,c_2) = (x_3,y_3,1)\times (x_4,y_4,1) //a_2x+b_2y+c_2=0$
- 2. Find their intersection point $p$
	- $p: (a_1,b_1,c_1)\times(a_2,b_2,c_2)$ //homogeneous coordinates
	- $p = (p_x,p_y)$
- 3. check if $p$ lies on both segments, if both conditions below hold:
	- $((p_x,p_y)-(x_1,y_1))\cdot((p_x,p_y)-(x_2,y_2))\leq 0$ //check if on line one
	- $((p_x,p_y)-(x_3,y_3))\cdot((p_x,p_y)-(x_4,y_4))\leq 0$ //check if on line two
### Quick Rejection
its more likely to not intersect than intersect so check for non intersection
- Stage 1:
	- [[quick rejection]] if bounding boxes do not intersect
		- if and only if $x_4 < x_1 \lor x_3 > x_2 \lor y_4 < y_1 \lor y_3>y_2$
- Stage 2:
	- the lines do not at least one of the two pairs of cross products below has the same signs
		- $(p_3 - p_2)\times(p_1-p_2) \land (p_4-p_2)\times(p_1-p_2)$
		- $(p_1 - p_4)\times(p_3-p_4) \land (p_2-p_4)\times(p_3-p_4)$

Brute Force for checking if n lines intersect cost $\Theta(n_2)$

i don't understand line sweep
for sweep line, tilt isn't real, just pick lower y value
