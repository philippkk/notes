### [[Graham Scan]]
- Steps:
	-  1. select node with smallest y coordinate
		- Tie breaker: select leftmost or rightmost point
	- 2. sort by polar angle with respect to $p_0$ 
		- $p_0$ is the lowest (and leftmost) meaning all polar angles $\in [0,\pi)$ 
		- **use cross product**. $p_i < p_j$ **GET FROM SLIDES**
			- If two points on same line, order by distance from $p_0$
				- **GET FROM SLIDES,** dot product part
				- keep furthest point from $p_0$, others have no chance of being hull vertex
	- 3. Scan points in the increasing order of polar angle, maintaining a stack.
		- left turn = push
		- right turn = pop
			- determine if last was right turn using cross product and pop 
			- finally push

for sweep line, tilt isn't real, just pick lower y value
