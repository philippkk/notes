- [[Isotope proxies]]
	- Oxygen isotopes relationship fractionation
		- describes how different mass isotopes behave differently in certain processes due to different mass
	- Hydrogen isotopes
	- depends on temperature
	- clumped isotopes: measures the number of bonds between heavy isotopes, like $^{13}C$ and $^{18}O$ 
- [[physical proxies]]
	- [[paleosols]] - ancient, preserved soils
		- the kinds of minerals in the soils depends on the composition of the atmosphere
		- can use to estimate ancient $CO_2$ levels 
		- found as old as 3.5 billion years old
	- [[non-geochemical proxies]]
		- rock and mineral deposits
		- use rocks formed by glaciers to tell when the earth was cold
		- use evaporite minerals to tell when the climate was hot
- [[global climate models]]
	- use a kind called a general circulation model
	- break earth up into grid cells
	- attempt to represent physical processes, weather, atomospehereic mixing, ocean circulation, land use
	- amazing at high-resolution, short time scale runs
	- can not simulate long time scales > 1000 years
- [[history of glacial periods]]
	- many more and longer as we get closer to current day
	- solar luminosity has increased over time about 30%
