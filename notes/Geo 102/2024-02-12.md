### Cenozoic 
- K-Pg aftermath
	- mammals radiate to take niches occupied by dinosaurs, birds radiate like crazy, ants, butterflies, termites, a lot of things
- Early cenozoic climate 
	- warm
	- paleocene-eocene thermal maximum
		- period of super warm conditions through the eocene
			- how do we know?
				- use O isotopes in benthic(bottom dwelling) foraminifera. Make their shells out of calcite
- PETM
	- Paleocene-ecocene thermal maximum
- Isotope track diet and ecosystem composition
	- used extensively in exosystem reconstruction! Use tooth enamel to see who was eating what and what environment was like.
