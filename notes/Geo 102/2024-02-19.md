### deep time climate and proxies
- Key questions
	- What has earths climate been like over long time scales?
	- How do we know?
	- what time periods are well-constrained, and which ones are poorly constrained?
- How do we measure earths climate?
	- Direct measurements
		- direct observations in the historical record: thermometers, $CO_2$ readings, humidity, pH,
		- awesome for the time period it exists,
		- ice cores: trapped atmospheric gases
	- Timescales of each technique
		- instrumental record goes back about 180 years
		- ice cores go back to almost a million years
		- deeper time requires proxy
	- Proxy:
		- something that is not a direct measurement, but is in someway controlled by it.
			1. tree ring
			2. sediments, cores and outcrops
			3. fossils
	- Delta notation
		- $\delta^{\times} E = \frac{R_{samp} - R_{standard}}{R_{standard}}\times 1000$
	- using records of $\delta^{18}O$
		- measure these in little fossils
		- benthic foraminifera
		- benthic = bottom water
		- bottom water is basically the same temperature everywhere
		- produces a globally coherent signal
