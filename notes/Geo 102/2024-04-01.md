### precambrian tectonics
- what did tectonics do in this time?
- it made the first continents, and *cratons*
	- What are cratons?
		- old, cold, thick, pieces of crust and mantle that tend to not break up.
	- How are they formed?
		- mantle plume origin
			- zone of hot material that rises from deep in the mantle towards the surface
		- oceanic lithosphere underthrusting and imbrication
			- horizontal stacking/compression 
		- arc thickening/accretion
		- formed 3.5 - 2 Ga
		- Melt mantle $\rightarrow$ basalt $\rightarrow$ granite
	- How are archean and proterozoic tectonics different than today?
		- use geochemical evidence
			- compare ancient rocks to modern settings, and different tectonic settings have distinct geochemical signatures.
			- 
	- Examples:
		- pilbara
		- isua
			- similar to modern subduction zone settings
	- when did tectonics begin?
		- plate tectonics
			- mantle convection
			- multiple, mobile lithospheric plates
			- subduction
			- mid ocean ridge spreading
			- mountain building/orogeny
			- transform boundaries
			- distinct oceanic and continental crust.
		- what to look for
			- ophiolites
			- high pressure metamorphic rocks: blueschists and eclogites
			- passive margins
			- continental crust/arcs volcano chemistry
