- [[Protoplanetary Disk]] - the solar system formed 4.56 billion years ago out of a disk of gas and dust.
	 - disk collapses on itself due to gravitational attraction
	 - Great majority of mass is the Sun, therefore the bulk composition of the Sun matches the bulk composition of the solar system.
	- Lighter materials (such as.. ) go out to the solar system, denser materials stay closer to the Sun
	- Planets [[accrete]] together by attraction of little bits that get bigger and bigger and bigger
	- fire the form [[planetesimals]], then a whole plant
#### what makes a planet
- [[Planetary differentiation]]
	- Once a planet is large enough, it gets hot. This cause it to differentiate
		- layers based on density
			- Iron droplets in atmosphere
			-  Top is magma ocean
				- Made of silicates, anything with $SiO_4$
	- [[Meteorites]] are leftover pieces of accretion, and they come in a variety of types:
		- Called based on if they have differentiated:
			- [[Chondrites]]: not differentiated, mix of iron and silicate.
			- [[Achonndrites]]: all silicates, much like basalt
			- [[Iron]]: all metal, remnant of planetesimal core
			- [[stony-iron]]: mix
- Lunar formation
	- Happened about 4.45 Ga, due to Giant Impact.
		- Mars-sized body named Theia
