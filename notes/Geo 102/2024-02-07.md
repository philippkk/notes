### Paleozoic
- lots of fossils with shells and bones
- rocks at surface in Iowa
- mass extinction intensity during the Phanerozoic
- How we classify life
	- for Eukaryotes it usually based on morphology, and for bacteria and archea, its based on genetic analysis
- Cambrian Explosion
	- first definitive fossil evidence for major groups of multicellular life
	- two main sites, China and British Columbia
	- groups first appear just after ediacaran-cambrian boundary
	- slight overlap with ediacaran fauna
- Ordovician events
	- first land plants evolve. something like a liverwort, which has no vascular tissue, so they live in wet environments
- Devonian events
	- a lot of fishes, early age of fish and sharks
	- forests
- Permian Events
	- 298.9 to 251.902 million years ago
	- climate was dry after rain forest collapse, amniotes evolved
	- terrestrial life diversifies into ancestors of dinosaurs and mammals
	- Pangaea is still here, starts to break up at the very end of the Permian
	- Permian-Triassic extinction, biggest extinction in earth history.
		- caused by huge volcano near Siberia 
- Mesozoic Era
	- 251.902 to 66 million years ago
	- first mammals
	- pangea breaks up
	- dinosaurs
	- diatoms
	- angiosperms: flowering parts
	- ocean anoxic events
	- end-cretaceous extinctions
- Triassic climate
	- lots of red beds, lots of evaporite: hot and dry
- Triassic life
	- first dinosaurs, about 20 Myr after PT
- Jurassic life
	- big sauropods
	- stegosaurus, allosaurus
	- first avian dinosaurs
- Cretaceous tectonics
	- looking more modern life
	- shallow sea in middle of north america
	- continents spreading a bit
- Cretaceous climate
	- warm everywhere
- K-PG extinction
	- k is from German for cretaceous, pg is for the Paleogene, the first period of the Cenozoic
		- one of 5 mass extinctions
		- tons of things go extinct
	- Giant impact in the Yucatan, Chicxulub crater
		- iridium anomaly: common in asteroids, uncommon on earth surface because its siderophile
		- shocked quartz
		- crater discovered in 1990
