- glacial ice ages
	- Sturtian (720-660 Ma)
	- marinoan (650-625 Ma)
- Agassiz - 19th century 
	- 1850s - glacial theory 
- since glaciation was identified in modern landscapes, ancient glaciations were identified in the rock record
- tills - glacial sediments
- in addition to tills, dropstones are also key glacial evidence
- enigmatic chemical sediments associated with glacial deposits around ~0.7 Ga
	- cap carbonates above shale with glacial dropstones, namibia
- how bif can form
	- look at slides for it
- paleo-magnetic studies find proterozoid glacial deposits formed at equatorial latitudes 
- what else was going on around the neoproterozoic
	- supercontinent rodinia, started breaking up around 1 Ga
	- fraklin large igneous province
		- northern canada
		- 2nd largest volcanic eruption in history 
	- glaciations coincide with biologic developments 
		- 0.57 Ga edicaran fauna
		- 0.9 ga preglacial algae
- how might these factors (rodinia location at equator, fraklin large igneous province, and biologic evolution lead to global glaciation?
