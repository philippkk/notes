### the [[archean eon]]
- from 4 to 2.5 Ga, for eras:
	- Eoarchean: 4 to 3.6 Ga
	- Paleoarchean: 3.6 to 3.2 Ga
	- Mesoarchean: 3.2 to 2.8 Gs
	- Neoarchean: 2.8 to 2.5 Ga
- What rocks of this age commonly found?
	- [[Cratons]] - Old, stable interiors of continents. Thick mantle root, cold.
- Oldest fossil life ~3.6 Ge
- [[Stromatolites]]
	- ~3.5 Ga = photosynthesis
	- Most abundant ~ 1 Ga
	- Microbial Mat
- What about the atmosphere?
	- lack of oxygen
- Evidence for archean atmospheric composition
	- Detrital pyrite/uraninite.
	- No red beds: oxidized sedimentary rocks.
- [[Great oxidation event]] - sudden increase 2.4 Ga
	- Oxygen photosynthesis 
		- single celled cyanobacteria- Prokaryotes
		- algae eukaryotes
	- lower sinks- methane $CH_4$ 
		- minerals
