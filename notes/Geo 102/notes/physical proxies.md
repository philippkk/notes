- [[physical proxies]]
	- paleosols - ancient, preserved soils
		- the kinds of minerals in the soils depends on the composition of the atmosphere
		- can use to estimate ancient $CO_2$ levels 
		- found as old as 3.5 billion years old
	- non-geochemical proxies
		- rock and mineral deposits
		- use rocks formed by glaciers to tell when the earth was cold
