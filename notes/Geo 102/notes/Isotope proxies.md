- [[Isotope proxies]]
	- Oxygen isotopes relationship fractionation
		- describes how different mass isotopes behave differently in certain processes due to different mass
	- Hydrogen isotopes
	- depends on temperature
	- clumped isotopes: measures the number of bonds between heavy isotopes, like $^{13}C$ and $^{18}O$
