- [[global climate models]]
	- use a kind called a general circulation model
	- break earth up into grid cells
	- attempt to represent physical processes, weather, atomospehereic mixing, ocean circulation, land use
	- amazing at high-resolution, short time scale runs
	- can not simulate long time scales > 1000 years
