#### Late paleozoic glaciation (360 - 260 Ma)
- not global in extent
- what caused it?
	- similar to neoproterozoic snowball earth.
	1. enhanced silicate weathering $\rightarrow$ $CO_2$ drawn into oceans from atmosphere
	2. floral evolution - expansion of land plants across continents also lowered atmospheric $CO_2$ glaciation at higher latitudes despite tropical-like condition over equatorial latitudes.
### Carboniferous period (360 - 300 ma)
- high oxygen content in atmosphere, estimated at 35% compared to 21% today
- high $O_2$ = big bugs
- carboniferous ends with the assembly of Pangea

### paleocene eocene thermal maximum
- warming event around ~55 Ma where average earth surface temp went up
- PETM observed in $\delta^{18}O$ record of ocean sediments
- benthic foraminifera, very small shells incorporate seawater
- high sea levels
- what started warming
	- earlier hypothesis suggested a "methane clathrate gun", or rapid release of hydrous underwater methane
	- recent research suggests volcanic $CO_2$ emissions preceded the warming event, and likely kicked off warming
	- other releases of terrestrial $CO_2$: coal bed destruction, tundra $CO_2$ release, etc
- how did it end
	- 83 thousand years long
	- increased biologic activity and high sea levels
	- more organic carbon burial = negative feedback mechanism drawing down atmospheric $CO_2$
