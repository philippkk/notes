### Paleoproterozoic
- Transition from the Archean
- Great oxidation event
- [[Banded Iron Formations]]
	- What are they?
		- alternating, thin layers of iron oxide and shale/chert
		- iron mineral either magnetite $Fe_3O_4$ or hematite $Fe_2O_3$
		- iron is oxidized
		- silica layer often red repeated
- [[Cyanobacteria evolution]]
	- single celled photosynthetic  bacteria, produces $O_2$
	- $H_2O + CO_2 \rightarrow CHO + O_2$
- [[Silicate-carbonate cycle]]
	- key cycle that maintains earths temperature over time
	- $CO_2$ causes weathering of silicate minerals
		- relies on one key mechanism: the weathering rate of silicate minerals depends on temperature
- Sturtian and mainoan glaciation
- [[Huronian glaciation]] - right after great oxidation event
	- Striations - shows past glaciation from lines carved in same orientation
	- Dropstones - rocks from inside of ice. Iceberg drops a stone 
	- Till - poorly sorted, matrix supported (big chunks of rock with mud?)
- more huronian
	- first described in 1908 by Arthur Philemon Coleman
	- rocks around lake Huron
	- after the GOE lasted from about 2.4 to 2.1 Ga
- Eukaryote evolution
	- First fossil eukaryote: Acritarch
	- [[Acritarch]]
		- Organic-walled micro fossil
		- difficult to classify
		- size and forms are consistent with eukaryotes
		- oldest are 1.8 Ga
	- [[Red Algae]]
		- From Canada, about 1 Ga
		- colonial, make these filaments
		- anthropomorphic
- [[Snowball Earth]]
	- When did it happen
		- Periods of global glaciation: Sturtian and Marionoan, Gaskiers likely regional
- Ediacaran
	- Right after the Cryogenian
	- Last period of the proterozoic
	- last from 635 to 541 Ma
	- named after type locality in Ediacaran hills
		- Fauana
			- Soft bodied
			- range in size from mm to m
			- clearly multicellular and ore complex than much previous life
			- unclear if sessile or motile
