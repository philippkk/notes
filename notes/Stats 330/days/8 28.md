## introduction to combinatorics 
- goo goo ga ga 
- If events in sample space are equally likely, then the probability of event A is given by:
	- $\mathbb{P}(A)=\frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$, where A is the number of elements in set A
- Multiplication Principle
- Sample selection
	- **with replacement**: after each selection, the object is put back in the box. It is possible to select the same object multiple times in k selections
	- **without replacement**: cannot select same object twice.
	- **ordered sample**: order of selected objects matters. 123 $\not =$ 321
	- **unordered sample**: steve bill bob = bob steve bill
- Three main scenarios (suppose a box has 3 letters a, b, c)
	- 1. Ordered with replacement
		- select 2 letters where repeat are allowed
			- $\Omega$ = {(a, a),(b, b),(c, c),(a, b),(b ,a),(a, c),(c, a),(b, c),(c, b)}
	- 2. Ordered without replacement
		- select 2 letter where repeats are **not** allowed
	- 3. underordered without replacement
		- consider a, b, c to be people, and you select 2 of them to be in your study.
			- $\Omega$ = {{a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}}
				- {a, b} and {b, a } are considered the same

- permutation: ordering of k distinct objects chosen from n objects.
	- permutation number: P(n, k), number of permutations of k distinct objects out of n objects. $P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$
