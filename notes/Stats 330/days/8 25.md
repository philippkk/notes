### two ways to think of probability
	- limiting relative frequency / frequency in long run
	- belief (bias)

 # two main approaches to assign probabilities to events at this point
	  - 1. when we know events are disjoint
			- let a collection of k outcomes that are all pairwise disjoint
			 - use axiom 3
	  -2. when events may or may not be disjoint
			- start with known probability
			- use info and axioms to deduce other events
			- draw ven diagrams

A class has 50 students, 20 male (M), 25  brown eye (B)
	what is probability of P(M $\cup$ B)?	 male OR brown eye
		P(M) = 0.4
		P(B) = 0.5
		P(M) + P(B) - P(M $\cap$ B) <- not known
		0.5 $\leq$ P(M $\cup$ B) $\leq$ 0.9

Larry has a coin that is not fair he will flip the coin twice,
	Which is more probable (HH,TT) or (HT,TH), same or different?
	TABLE
	              flip one
	flip two  H       T
	          H  HH   HT     $p^2$       $p * q$    
	          T   HT    TT     $q * p$   $q^2$    
	          $p^2 + q^2 - 2pq$ = $(p-q)^2 > 0$
	          so pick same
